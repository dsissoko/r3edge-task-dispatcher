*   **README.md:** Comprehensive, well-structured, and provides clear instructions for integration, configuration, and authentication.
*   **Functionality:** The library offers declarative task definition via YAML, extensible task handling, and dynamic hot-reloading, which are valuable features for Spring Boot applications.
*   **Test Results:** All Gradle tests passed successfully, indicating that the core functionalities are working as expected and are covered by existing tests.
*   **Objective Feedback:** The library is a well-designed and simplified solution for declarative task management. It demonstrates clear separation of concerns, extensibility, and robust documentation. The explicit warning about distributed environments is a good practice.

**Conclusion:** The simplification efforts have resulted in a focused, effective, and user-friendly library. The clear documentation and successful tests are strong indicators of a robust solution.
